    "**What is this workbook?** \n",
    "A workbook is a collection of problems, accompanied by solutions to them. The explanations focus on the logical steps required to solve a problem; they illustrate the concepts that need to be applied to come up with a solution to the problem, explaining the mathematical steps required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a workbook should not be the primary source of knowledge on the subject matter; it assumes that you've already read a tutorial or a textbook and that you are now seeking to improve your problem-solving skills. You should attempt solving the tasks of the respective kata first, and turn to the workbook only if stuck or for reinforcement. While a textbook emphasizes knowledge acquisition, a workbook emphasizes skill acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook describes the solutions to the problems offered in the [Basic Gates Kata](./BasicGates.ipynb). \n",
    "Since the tasks are offered as programming problems, the explanations also cover some elements of Q# that might be non-obvious for a novitiate."

We have also just seen in Task 1.9 how to change our input state to the state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\big(|01\\rangle + |10\\rangle\\big)$, which is almost our goal state (disregarding the phase change for the moment). So it would seem that a combination of these two gates wiill be what we need here. The remaining question is in what order to apply them, and to which qubit.\n",

    "Compare our two inputs qubits in the state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle$ with the output qubits in the state $\\alpha |00\\rangle + \\beta |11\\rangle$. We want to pass our inputs through a gate, or gates, to be decided, that do the following. If A is in a 0 state ,then we want to leave B alone. However if A is in 1 state we want to flip B from 0 into a 1 state. So, in other words, the state of B is to be made contingent upon the state of A. This gate exists and is called a CNOT (for controlled not)  gate. Dependent upon the value of what is know as the **control** qubit (A in our case) the value of the controlled or **target** qubit (B in our case) is inverted.  Thus we get the output of $\\alpha |00\\rangle + \\beta |11\\rangle$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth emphasizing that A is initially a superposition, having a measured value of $|\\alpha^{2}|of either or  |\\beta^{2}| where $|\\alpha^{2}| + |\\beta^{2}| for normalisation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth remembering the significance of  Bell pairs, refering to the $|\\Phi^{+}\\rangle$ pair, given as the goal, in this case. The goal can be described, as we have done in Task 1.8, as $|\\Phi^{+}\\rangle = \\alpha |0_{A}0_{B}\\rangle + \\beta|1_{A}1_{B}\\rangle$.  \n",
    "If A measures her qubit and gets the state $|0\\rangle$, (with a probability of  $|\\alpha^{2}|$) and if B **then** measures his qubit he will also get a $|0\\rangle$  because the whole state has 'collapsed' under the measurement of A's qubit leaving B with  $|0\\rangle$. We could represent this measurement as $\\alpha |00\\rangle + \\beta |10\\rangle -->|00\\rangle$.  Similarly, A measuring a $|1\\rangle$ will guarantee that B measures the same. An identical situation obtains if B measures first, guaranteeing  A the same result as B. It is important to keep well in mind when thinking about and computing with Bell states that the way state is written doesn't mean or imply that the qubits are physically joined in any way; they can be any arbitrary distance apart and the Bell state property we have described has beeen confirmed experimentally many times."

As it's more useful to investigate a genreral case and then use it to perfrom a specific state change, lets look for a 2-qubit phase shift. The other thing we notice is, like in Task 2.1, the phase shift only ocurs on qs[1], so this suggests it might be a conditional shift. Inspired by our solution to Task2.1, we notice that if we could have our phase shift conditional on qs[0] being in the state $|1\\rangle$ when we apply the gate, then we would have a description of our gate. If we now look though a list of gates, for example [here](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/introduction-to-quantum-computing/) under the  CQasm  sub-heading instructions on the left we see that the CR gate is a controlled phase shift with angle $\\theta$ (radians), defined by"
