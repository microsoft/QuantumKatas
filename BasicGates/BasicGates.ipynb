    "to get you familiar with the basic quantum gates in Q#.\n",
    "It covers the following topics:\n",

    "* adjoint and controlled gates,\n",
    "* using gates to modify the state of a qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.\n",
