# Welcome!

The Basic Gates kata covers the basic operations (a.k.a. "gates") used in quantum computing, as well as the concept of controlled and adjoint versions of gates.

You can [run the Basic Gates kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?urlpath=/notebooks/BasicGates%2FBasicGates.ipynb)!

#### Theory

* A list of most common gates can be found in [the Quantum logic gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate) Wikipedia article.
* [Quirk](http://algassert.com/quirk) is a convenient tool for visualizing the effect of gates on qubit states.

#### Q# materials

* Basic gates provided in Q# belong to the [Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic).
* Using and defining controlled and adjoint versions of gates is covered in the [Q# user guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/user-guide/language/expressions/functorapplication).
