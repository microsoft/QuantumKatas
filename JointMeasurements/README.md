# Welcome!

The joint measurements kata covers the usage of joint measurements, also known as parity measurements, - 
measurements involving multiple qubits.

In Q# they are implemented as the [Measure](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.measure) operation.

* You can read more about measurements of multi-qubit Pauli operators in the [Q# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/concepts/pauli-measurements).
* A general-case implementation of CNOT gate via joint measurements is described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5734.pdf).
