    "* In Q# joint measurements are implemented as the [Measure](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.measure) operation.\n",
    "* You can read more about measurements of multi-qubit Pauli operators in the [Q# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/concepts-pauli-measurements).\n",
