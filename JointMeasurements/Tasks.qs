    // "Joint Measurements" quantum kata is a series of exercises designed
    // to get you familiar with programming in Q#.
    // It covers the joint parity measurements and using them for distinguishing quantum states
    // or for performing multi-qubit gates.
    
    // Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.
    // Each task (except tasks in which you have to write a test) has a unit test associated with it,
    // which initially fails. Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comment)
    // with some Q# code to make the failing test pass.
    
    // The tasks are given in approximate order of increasing difficulty; harder ones are marked with asterisks.
    
    
    // Task 1. Single-qubit measurement
    // Input: Two qubits (stored in an array) which are guaranteed to be
    //        either in superposition of states |00⟩ and |11⟩
    //        or in superposition of states |01⟩ and |10⟩.
    // Output: 0 if qubits were in the first superposition,
    //         1 if they were in the second superposition.
    // The state of the qubits at the end of the operation does not matter.
    operation SingleQubitMeasurement (qs : Qubit[]) : Int {

    // Input: Two qubits (stored in an array) which are guaranteed to be
    //        either in superposition of states |00⟩ and |11⟩
    //        or in superposition of states |01⟩ and |10⟩.
    // Output: 0 if qubits were in the first superposition,
    //         1 if they were in the second superposition.
    // The state of the qubits at the end of the operation should be the same as the starting state.

    // Input: Four qubits (stored in an array) which are guaranteed to be
    //        either in superposition of states |0000⟩ and |1111⟩
    //        or in superposition of states |0011⟩ and |1100⟩.
    // Output: 0 if qubits were in the first superposition,

    //        either in a superposition of states |0..0⟩ and |1..1⟩ (the GHZ state https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state)
    //        or in the W state ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_state ).
    // Output: 0 if qubits were in the first superposition,

    //        (this can be written as two-qubit state (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩).
    // Goal:  Change the two-qubit state to α |00⟩ + β |11⟩ using only single-qubit gates and joint measurements.
