    "Note that a workbook should not be the primary source of knowledge on the subject matter; it assumes that you've already read a tutorial or a textbook and that you are now seeking to improve your problem-solving skills. You should attempt solving the tasks of the respective kata first, and turn to the workbook only if stuck. While a textbook emphasizes knowledge acquisition, a workbook emphasizes skill acquisition.\n",
