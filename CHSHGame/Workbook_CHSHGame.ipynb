    "A workbook is a collection of problems, accompanied by solutions to them. \n",
    "The explanations focus on the logical steps required to solve a problem; they illustrate the concepts that need to be applied to come up with a solution to the problem, explaining the mathematical steps required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a workbook should not be the primary source of knowledge on the subject matter; it assumes that you've already read a tutorial or a textbook and that you are now seeking to improve your problem-solving skills. You should attempt solving the tasks of the respective kata first, and turn to the workbook only if stuck. While a textbook emphasizes knowledge acquisition, a workbook emphasizes skill acquisition.\n",
