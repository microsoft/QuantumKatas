    "Each of them is given a bit (r, s and t respectively), and\n",
    "they have to return new bits (a, b and c respectively) so\n",
    "that  r ∨ s ∨ t = a ⊕ b ⊕ c. The input bits will have\n",
    "zero or two bits set to true and three or one bits set to false.\n",
    "The trick is, the players can not communicate during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ∨ is the standard bitwise OR operator.\n",
    "* ⊕ is the exclusive or, or XOR operator, so (P ⊕ Q) is true if exactly one of P and Q is true.\n",
