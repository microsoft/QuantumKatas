# Welcome!

The Functional Programming Techniques kata begins by covering the basics of using functional programming in Q# using classical operations and then adds Quantum operations to that foundation.

#### Theory

* The general theory behind functional programming can be found here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming
* A tremendous introduction to the mathematics behind Category Theory and how Category Theory informs Functional Programming, see:  https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/

#### Q# materials

* For Q#, the first thing to learn about functions is how they are manifest in Q# as either Functions for Operations:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/user-guide/using-qsharp/operations-functions
* Since Operations are intended for Quantum uses, they also support the Functors Controlled and Adjoint:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/user-guide/using-qsharp/operations-functions#controlled-and-adjoint-operations
* The next step is to understand how the higher-order functions are utilitized in the Quantum Libraries:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/user-guide/libraries/standard/control-flow
