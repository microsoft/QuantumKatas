    "A workbook is a collection of problems, accompanied by solutions to them. \n",
    "The explanations focus on the logical steps required to solve a problem; they illustrate the concepts that need to be applied to come up with a solution to the problem, explaining the mathematical steps required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a workbook should not be the primary source of knowledge on the subject matter; it assumes that you've already read a tutorial or a textbook and that you are now seeking to improve your problem-solving skills. You should attempt solving the tasks of the respective kata first, and turn to the workbook only if stuck. While a textbook emphasizes knowledge acquisition, a workbook emphasizes skill acquisition.\n",

    "This workbook describes the solutions to the problems offered in the [Key Distribution BB84 kata](./KeyDistribution_BB84.ipynb). \n",

    "Now that all the pieces are in place, it is time for us to implement the entire protocol. We will need to utilize all the tasks we have completed so far in order to accomplish the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to revise, here are the steps we need to follow:\n",
    "1. Alice generates a random set of bits to encode her qubits, and a random array to decide which bases she would use. To achieve this, she can leverage our [Task 2.1. Generate random array](#generate_random_array), and define two variables `bitsAlice` and `basesAlice`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now, Alice can prepare her qubits using the previously generated `bitsAlice` and `basesAlice`. For this, we need to declare an array of qubits `qs` and leverage [Task 2.2. Prepare Alice's qubits](#prepare_alice_qubits) to encode them: `PrepareAlicesQubits(qs, basesAlice, bitsAlice)`. Now Alice is ready to send her qubits to Bob, which is not reflected in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, Bob also needs to create a random set of bases which he would use to measure the qubits in. This again can be achieved using [Task 2.1. Generate random array](#generate_random_array). This would give us `basesBob`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now Bob will use his array of random bases to measure Alice's qubits. For this, we can leverage our [Task 2.3. Measure Bob's qubits](#measure_bob_qubits): `MeasureBobsQubits(qs, basesBob)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Alice and Bob prepare the shared key by comparing the bases used by them in their preparation/measurements. Referring to [Task 2.4. Generate the shared key!](#generate_the_shared_key), we can create shared keys as `GenerateSharedKey(basesAlice, basesBob, bitsAlice)` and `GenerateSharedKey(basesAlice, basesBob, bitsBob)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, we have to implement the key validation step to ensure there was no eavesdropper. We define a threshold value for the errorRate and use [Task 2.5. Check if error rate was low enough](#check_error_rate) to perform this operation: `CheckKeysMatch(keyAlice, keyBob, threshold)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes our implementation of how Alice and Bob can generate a shared key using BB84 protocol. "
