    "**What is this workbook?**\n",
    "A workbook is a collection of problems, accompanied by solutions to them. \n",
    "The explanations focus on the logical steps required to solve a problem; they illustrate the concepts that need to be applied to come up with a solution to the problem, explaining the mathematical steps required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a workbook should not be the primary source of knowledge on the subject matter; it assumes that you've already read a tutorial or a textbook and that you are now seeking to improve your problem-solving skills. You should attempt solving the tasks of the respective kata first, and turn to the workbook only if stuck. While a textbook emphasizes knowledge acquisition, a workbook emphasizes skill acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook describes the solutions to the problems offered in the [Key Distribution BB84 kata](./KeyDistribution_BB84.ipynb). \n",
    "Since the tasks are offered as programming problems, the explanations also cover some elements of Q# that might be non-obvious for a first-time user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should know for this workbook**\n",

    "You should be familiar with the following concepts before tackling the Key Distribution - BB84 Kata (and this workbook):\n",
    "1. Basic Qubit Operations\n",
    "2. The concept of measurement"

    "While preparing qubits in Quantum Key Distribution, Alice is required to choose a random bit string. For each bit, she has to choose the bases in which it should be measured so that in case Eve wants to read this data, she would be in equal probability of getting the correct or the wrong answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are required to choose two bases to achieve the the same. In pratical implementation, this refers to choosing different types of polarization. Each photon is either polarized in Rectilinear Basis or in Diagonal Basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first type of basis (referred above as Rectilinear Basis or Computational Basis), Alice would prepares the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ where $|0\\rangle$ stands for bit value `0` and $|1\\rangle$ stands for bit value `1`. The second basis (referred above as the diagonal basis or Hadamard Basis) represents bit value `0` as the states $|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$, and bit value `1` as $|-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$."
