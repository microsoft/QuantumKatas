    "\n",
    "The **\"Unitary Patterns\"** quantum kata is a series of exercises designed\n",
    "to get you comfortable with creating unitary transformations which can be represented\n",
    "with matrices of certain shapes (with certain pattern of zero and non-zero values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.\n",
    "Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with the `// ...` comments)\n",
    "with some Q# code that solves the task. To verify your answer, run the cell using Ctrl+Enter (âŒ˜+Enter on macOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each section, tasks are given in approximate order of increasing difficulty; \n",
    "harder ones are marked with asterisks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task describes a matrix which your unitary needs to implement.\n",
    "The row and column indices of the matrix elements are in little-endian format (the least significant bit is stored first).\n",
    "For example, index 1 corresponds to the qubit state $|10...0\\rangle$, and to store this state in an array of qubits `qs` \n",
    "its first element `qs[0]` would have to be in state $|1\\rangle$ and the rest of the qubits would have to be in state $|0\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example patterns provided in the tasks, `X` marks a \"non-zero\" element, and `.` marks a \"zero\" element.\n",
    "A \"zero\" element of a matrix is a complex number which has an absolute value of 0.001 or less,\n",
    "and a \"non-zero\" element is a complex number which has an absolute value of 0.001 or greater.\n",
    "You can see the details of the verification in [`Tests.qs`](.\\Tests.qs) file, operation `AssertOperationMatrixMatchesPattern`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all tasks require you to implement a unitary transformation,\n",
    "which means that you're not allowed to use any measurements."
