# Welcome!

The "Unitary Patterns" kata offers tasks on creating unitary transformations which can be represented 
with matrices of certain shapes (with certain pattern of zero and non-zero values).

You can [run the Unitary Patterns kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?urlpath=/notebooks/UnitaryPatterns%2FUnitaryPatterns.ipynb)!
