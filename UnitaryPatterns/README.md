# Welcome!

The "Unitary Patterns" kata offers tasks on creating unitary transformations which can be represented 
with matrices of certain shapes (with certain pattern of zero and non-zero values).

You can [run the Unitary Patterns kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?urlpath=/notebooks/UnitaryPatterns%2FUnitaryPatterns.ipynb)!

A lot of tasks of this kata have been featured in the Microsoft Q# Coding Contest - Winter 2019. 
You can find the descriptions of their solutions in the editorials for the 
[warmup round](https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1115/warmup-editorial.pdf) and for the 
[main contest](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65702).
