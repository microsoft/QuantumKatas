    "The **W Game** quantum kata is an original series of exercises based on the katas for the GHZ\n",
    "and CHSH games, introducing an original game inspired by these and referred to here as the \"W game\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In it three players (Alice, Bob and Charlie) try to win the following game:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of them is given a bit (r, s and t respectively), and\n",
    "they have to return new bits (a, b and c respectively) so\n",
    "that the sum (number of true bits) of their output bits corresponds\n",
    "to the sum of the input bits in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------+\n",
    "|    Number of true bits in     |        Number of true bits in         |\n",
    "|    input between players      |        output needed to win           |\n",
    "+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------+\n",
    "|              0                |               exactly 1               |\n",
    "|              2                |   0, 2, or 3 (i.e. any number but 1)  |\n",
    "+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The input will have zero or two bits set to true, and one or three bits set to false.\n",
    "The trick is, the players can not communicate during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also,** in this game, all the players have to use the same approach, **if** dependent on the input (i.e. in this game, the team may not have Charlie follow a different protocol from Alice and Bob, **if** any of the protocols depend on the input).  **However,** this restriction only applies to strategies for which the composition of the team's output bits could vary; the rules permit them individual strategies that are independent of the input (such as Bob always outputs true while Alice and Charlie output false) allowing them to ensure that exactly one true bit gets submitted between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The W state represents one of the two non-biseparable classes of three-qubit entangled states; the GHZ state represents the other.  These two states cannot be transformed into each other by local (one-qubit) quantum operations, and therefore represent two fundamentally distinct types of tripartite entanglement.
