# Welcome!

This kata continues the exploration of the Grover's search algorithm started in the "Grover's Algorithm" kata. 
It teaches writing oracles for the algorithm which describe the problem instead of the solution, using graph coloring problem as an example. 
Then it takes the implementation of the Grover's search to the next level, covering solving the problems with unknown number of solutions.

You can [run the Graph Coloring kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?filepath=GraphColoring%2FGraphColoring.ipynb)!

* [This Microsoft Learn module](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/) walks you through solving graph coloring problems using Grover's search.
* You can read more about [graph coloring problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) on Wikipedia.
* It is strongly recommended to complete the [Grover's Algorithm kata](./../GroversAlgorithm/) before proceeding to this one. You can also refer to its [README.md](./../GroversAlgorithm/README.md) for the list of resources on Grover's algorithm.
* [SolveSATWithGrover](./../SolveSATWithGrover/) is another kata covering oracle implementation for solving constraint satisfaction problems.
