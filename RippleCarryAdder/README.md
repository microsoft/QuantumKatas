# Welcome!

This kata explores ripple-carry addition on a quantum computer.

* The simplest quantum adder, covered in part I, closely mirrors its classical counterpart,
using the same basic components and the same algorithm.
* Part II explores building an in-place adder.
* A more complex version of an in-place adder covered in part III of the kata uses a different algorithm
to reduce the number of ancillary qubits needed.
* Part IV covers building an in-place quantum subtractor.
* Part V covers addition and subtraction modulo 2ᴺ.

You can [run the RippleCarryAdder kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?filepath=RippleCarryAdder%2FRippleCarryAdder.ipynb)!

#### Theory

* [Classical binary adder on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)).
* Part 2 of the [paper on quantum binary addition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0008033.pdf) by Thomas G. Draper explains how to adapt the classical adder to a quantum environment.
* [Paper on improved ripple carry addition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0410184.pdf) by Steven A. Cuccaro, Thomas G. Draper, Samuel A. Kutin, and David Petrie Moulton 
  explains the principle behind the adder in part III of the kata.

#### Q#

It is recommended to complete the [BasicGates kata](./../BasicGates/) before this one to get familiar with the basic gates used in quantum computing.
The list of basic gates available in Q# can be found at [Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic).

For the syntax of flow control statements in Q#, see [Q# iterations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/user-guide/language/statements/iterations) and [Q# conditional branching](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/user-guide/language/statements/conditionalbranching) documentation.
