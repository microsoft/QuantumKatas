# Welcome!

The superposition kata covers the following topics:
 - basic single-qubit and multi-qubit gates,
 - superposition,
 - flow control and recursion in Q#.

 You can [run the Superposition kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?urlpath=/notebooks/Superposition%2FSuperposition.ipynb)!

It is recommended to complete the [BasicGates kata](./../BasicGates/) before this one to get familiar with the basic gates used in quantum computing. 
The list of basic gates available in Q# can be found at [Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic).

You can find detailed coverage of Bell states and their creation [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2018/02/06/a-beginners-guide-to-quantum-computing-and-q/).

For the syntax of flow control statements in Q#, see [Q# iterations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/user-guide/language/statements/iterations) and [Q# conditional branching](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/user-guide/language/statements/conditionalbranching) documentation.
