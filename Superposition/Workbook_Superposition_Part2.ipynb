    "Since the desired superposition has 4 basis states with equal amplitudes, we are going to need two qubits to define a unique basis to control preparation of each of the basis states in the superposition. \n",

    "\n",
    "Then, for each of the four given bit strings, we walk through it and prepare the matching basis state on the main register of qubits, using controlled X gates with the corresponding basis state of the auxiliary qubits as control. \n",
    "For example, when preparing the bit string `bits[0]`, we apply X gates controlled on the basis state $|00\\rangle$; when preparing the bit string `bits[1]`, we apply X gates controlled on $|10\\rangle$, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We can choose an arbitrary matching of the 2-qubit basis states used as controls and the bit strings prepared on the main register. \n",
    "> Since all amplitudes are the same, the result does not depend on which state controlled which bit string preparation.\n",
    "> It can be convenient to use indices of the bit strings, converted to little-endian, to control preparation of the bit strings.\n",
