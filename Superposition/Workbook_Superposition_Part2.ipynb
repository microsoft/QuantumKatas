    "\n",
    "The first approach we will describe relies on performing a sequence of controlled rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare a weighted superposition $\\cos \\theta |0\\rangle + \\sin \\theta |1\\rangle$ on a single qubit, we need to start with the $|0\\rangle$ state and apply the [Ry gate](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.ry) to it with the angle parameter equal to $2 \\theta$. \n",
    "We'll apply the Ry gate with angle $2 \\theta_1 = 2\\arcsin \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$ to the first qubit of the register to prepare the following state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\cos \\theta_1 |0\\rangle + \\sin \\theta_1 |1\\rangle) \\otimes |0 \\dots 0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}|10 \\dots 0\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{N-1}}{\\sqrt{N}}|00 \\dots 0\\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}|10 \\dots 0\\rangle$ already matches the first term of the $|W_N\\rangle$ state; now we need to convert the second term $\\frac{\\sqrt{N-1}}{\\sqrt{N}}|00 \\dots 0\\rangle$ into the rest of the $|W_N\\rangle$ terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare a term that matches the second term of the $|W_N\\rangle$ state, we can apply another Ry gate to the term $|00 \\dots 0\\rangle$, this time to the second qubit, with an angle $2 \\theta_2 = 2\\arcsin \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N-1}}$.\n",
    "To make sure it doesn't affect the term that we're already happy with, we will apply a controlled version of the Ry gate, with the first qubit of the register in state $|0\\rangle$ as control.\n",

    "Now we have two terms that match the terms of the $|W_N\\rangle$ state, and need to convert the third term $\\frac{\\sqrt{N-2}}{\\sqrt{N}}|00 \\dots 0\\rangle$ into the rest of terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will keep going like this, preparing one term of the $|W_N\\rangle$ state at a time, until the rotation on the last qubit will be an X gate, controlled on all previous qubits being in the $|0 \\dots 0\\rangle$ state."
