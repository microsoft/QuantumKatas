That way you end up with ($|10\\rangle$ + $|01\\rangle$)/$\\sqrt{2}$ and not just $|01\\rangle$. This can be done by using a controlled SWAP with an ancilla, we just need to be sure the uncompute the ancilla when we are finished. \n",

    "The problem may be more manageable if broken down into the simplest version of the problem. A single qubit is a bit uninteresting as there is only one qubit where the 1 can go, the state is simply $|1\\rangle$. Two qubits is a little more interesting though, we want to start with $|10\\rangle$ and do a controlled SWAP between the two qubits to get ($|10\\rangle$+$|01\\rangle$)/$\\sqrt{2}$ using an ancilla that has been prepared to the $|+\\rangle$ state with an H gate. Using an H gate on the ancilla means the two states before an after the SWAP will be in an even superposition. However, the ancilla is now entangled with the rest of the qubits, so we can't simply reset it without it affecting the superposition we have prepared with it. We will need to uncompute the ancilla by carefully considering what happened with it when we used it in the controlled SWAP. \n",

This same part of the superposition was used in the controlled SWAP; controlled operators do nothing on $|0\\rangle$. If we collect up the effects of the SWAP and act on them, we will be acting only on the part of the entangled system where the ancilla was treated as $|1\\rangle$, and will be able to perform a Not on it to bring it back to $|0\\rangle$, without performing the same Not on the $|0\\rangle$ part of the ancilla’s superposition. This translates to doing a controlled X on the ancilla with the effects of the SWAP as the control. For our 2-qubit example, the effect of a successful SWAP brings the register to $|01\\rangle$, so we can just use the second qubit as the control for our uncompute. \n",

    "If we take this one step further, we have a register of 4-qubits (only powers of 2 are allowed for the size). We can see that this is a scaled up version of the 2-qubit example. If we assume the first two qubits are in the W state, we simply want to SWAP that W state forward into the next two qubits with an even superposition. We again use an ancilla in the $|+\\rangle$ state and use it for a controlled SWAP of each qubit in the first half with the corresponding qubit in the second half. Now all that's left is the uncompute. The results from a successful SWAP is that the latter two qubits went from $|00\\rangle$ to ($|10\\rangle$+$|01\\rangle$)/$\\sqrt{2}$. The result of the SWAP, and consequently the $|1\\rangle$ state from the ancilla, is spread out over the latter two qubits, so we will loop through those qubits and use them in individual CNOT operations against the ancilla. \n",
    "  \n",
    "This means that we can break this problem up with recursion, with our base case being the first qubit having a NOT gate applied from $|0\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$, which is its W state. All other interactions of the recursion will take require the the first half of the register being in its W state, and use an ancilla to control-SWAP that W state forward into its second half, then uncomputing the ancilla by applying a CNOT operation against the ancilla with each qubit from the second half of the register."
