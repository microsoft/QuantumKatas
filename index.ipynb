    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Kata Notebooks and Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Each kata notebook presents the tasks of the respective kata (Q# project) in Jupyter Notebook format. This makes getting started with the katas a lot easier - you don't need to install anything locally to try them out!\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook tutorials are designed with Notebook format in mind - in addition to programming exercises they include a lot of theoretical explanations and code samples for you to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you're viewing this file on Binder (if not, use [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/master?filepath=index.ipynb)). From here you can navigate to the individual kata or tutorial notebooks using the links above.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each tutorial or kata notebook contains a sequence of tasks on the topic, progressing from trivial to challenging.\n",
    "* Each task is defined in a separate code cell, preceded by the description of the task in a Markdown cell.\n",
    "  Your goal is to fill in the blanks in the code (marked with `// ...` comments) with some Q# code that solves the task. \n",
    "* To verify your solution, run the code cell using Ctrl + Enter (or ⌘ + Enter on macOS). This will invoke the test covering the task and let you know whether it passes or fails, and if it fails, what the error is.\n",
    "* You can find pointers to reference materials you might need to solve the tasks, both on quantum computing and on Q#, either in the beginning of the tutorial or the kata or next to the task to which they are relevant.\n",
    "* You can find reference solutions in `ReferenceImplementation.qs` files of the corresponding katas or tutorials."
