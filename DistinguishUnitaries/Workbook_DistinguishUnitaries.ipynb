    "**What is this workbook?**\n",
    "A workbook is a collection of problems, accompanied by solutions to them. \n",
    "The explanations focus on the logical steps required to solve a problem; they illustrate the concepts that need to be applied to come up with a solution to the problem, explaining the mathematical steps required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a workbook should not be the primary source of knowledge on the subject matter; it assumes that you've already read a tutorial or a textbook and that you are now seeking to improve your problem-solving skills. You should attempt solving the tasks of the respective kata first, and turn to the workbook only if stuck. While a textbook emphasizes knowledge acquisition, a workbook emphasizes skill acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook describes the solutions to the problems offered in the [Distinguish Unitaries kata](./DistinguishUnitaries.ipynb). Since the tasks are offered as programming problems, the explanations also cover some elements of Q# that might be non-obvious for a first-time user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should know for this workbook**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be familiar with the following concepts before tackling the Distinguish Unitaries kata (and this workbook):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Basic linear algebra](./../tutorials/LinearAlgebra/LinearAlgebra.ipynb)).\n",
    "2. [The concept of qubit](./../tutorials/Qubit/Qubit.ipynb) and [multi-qubit systems](./../tutorials/MultiQubitSystems/MultiQubitSystems.ipynb).\n",
    "3. [Single-qubit](./../tutorials/SingleQubitGates/SingleQubitGates.ipynb) and [multi-qubit quantum gates](./../tutorials/MultiQubitGates/MultiQubitGates.ipynb) and using them to manipulate the state of the system.\n",

    "The only way to extract information out of a quantum system is measurement. \n",

    "To do this, we’ll need to find a qubit state that, by applying to it I gate or X gate, will be transformed into states that can be distinguished using measurement, i.e., orthogonal states. \n",
    "Let's find such state.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a reminder, here are the matrices that correspond to the given gates:\n",

    "\n",
    "We see that the **I** gate leaves the $|0\\rangle$ state unchanged, and the **X** gate transforms it into the $|1\\rangle$ state. \n",
    "So the easiest thing to do is to prepare a $|0\\rangle$ state, apply the given unitary to it and measure the resulting state in the computational basis:\n",
    "* If the measurement result is `Zero`, the measured state was $|0\\rangle$, and we know the unitary applied to it was the **I** gate.\n",
    "* If the measurement result is `One`, the measured state was $|1\\rangle$, and we know the unitary applied to it was the **X** gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Q#, the freshly allocated qubits start in the $|0\\rangle$ state, so you don't need to do anything to prepare the necessary state before applying the unitary to it.\n",
    "> You also have to return the qubits you allocated to the $|0\\rangle$ state before releasing them. \n",
    "> You can do that by measuring the qubit using the `M` operation and applying the **X** gate if it was measured in the $|1\\rangle$ state, or you can use [`MResetZ`](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.measurement.mresetz) operation that wraps this measurement and fixup into one operation."
