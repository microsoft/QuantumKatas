    "# Superdense Coding Kata\n",
    "\n",
    "**Superdense Coding** quantum kata is a series of exercises designed to get you familiar with programming in Q#.\n",
    "\n",
    "It covers the superdense coding protocol which allows us to transmit two bits of classical information by sending just one qubit using previously shared quantum entanglement.\n",
    "\n",
    " - A good description can be found in [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding).\n",
    " - A great interactive demonstration can be found [on the Wolfram Demonstrations Project](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SuperdenseCoding/).\n",
    " - Superdense coding protocol is described in Nielsen & Chuang, section 2.3 (pp. 97-98).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task. Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with `// ...` comment) with some Q# code that solves the task. To verify your answer, run the cell using Ctrl+Enter (âŒ˜+Enter on macOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task defines an operation that can be used in subsequent tasks to simplify implementations and build on existing code.  We split the superdense coding protocol into several steps, following the description in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preparation (creating the entangled pair of qubits that are sent to Alice and Bob).\n",
    "* Encoding the message (Alice's task): Encoding the classical bits of the message into the state of Alice's qubit which then is sent to Bob.\n",
    "* Decoding the message (Bob's task): Using Bob's original qubit and the qubit he received from Alice to decode the classical message sent.\n",
    "* Finally, we compose those steps into the complete superdense coding protocol."
