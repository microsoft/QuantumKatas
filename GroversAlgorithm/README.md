# Welcome!

The Grover's Algorithm kata covers Grover's search algorithm, which is one of the fundamental quantum computing algorithms.
It solves the problem of finding an input to a black box (oracle) that produces a particular output.

You can [run the GroversAlgorithm kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/master?filepath=GroversAlgorithm%2FGroversAlgorithm.ipynb)!

#### Theory

* The tasks follow the explanation from *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen and Chuang.
  In the 10th anniversary edition, this is section 6.1.2 on pages 248-251.
* A different explanation of Grover's algorithm can be found in 
  [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm).
* [An Introduction to Quantum Algorithms](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~strubell/doc/quantum_tutorial.pdf) by Emma Strubell, pages 20-24.
* [Lecture 4: Grover's Algorithm](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/quantum15/lecture04.pdf) by John Wright.
* Lectures [12](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/LectureNotes/CPSC519.Winter2006/12.pdf) and [13](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/LectureNotes/CPSC519.Winter2006/13.pdf) by John Watrous.
* [This page](http://davidbkemp.github.io/animated-qubits/grover.html) has an animated demonstration of Grover's algorithm for a simple case.

#### Q# materials

* Q# Samples repository has an [implementation of Grover's search](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/samples/algorithms/database-search).
