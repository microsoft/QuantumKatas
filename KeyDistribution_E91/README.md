# Welcome!

The **E91 Quantum Key Distribution** kata is a series of exercises designed to teach you about a quantum key distribution protocol called [E91](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution#E91_protocol:_Artur_Ekert_.281991.29).

You can [run the KeyDistribution_E91 kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?urlpath=/notebooks/KeyDistribution_E91%2FKeyDistribution_E91.ipynb)!
