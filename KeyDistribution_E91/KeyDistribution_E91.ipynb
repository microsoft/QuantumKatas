This doesn't mean that all other outcomes are useless though. They can be used to measure the correlation between Alice and Bob's qubits. The famous CHSH inequality provides an easy way to compute this correlation. The CHSH coefficient $S$ is given by $$S = E(P_1, P_2) - E(P_1, P_4) + E(P_3, P_2) + E(P_3, P_4),$$ where $E(P_i, P_j)$ is the expectation value of the ocurrences when Alice measures in $P_i$ and Bob measures in $P_j$. These expectation values can be computed using the realtion $$E(P_i, P_j) = \\frac{N_{00}(P_i, P_j) - N_{01}(P_i, P_j) - N_{10}(P_i, P_j) + N_{11}(P_i, P_j)}{N_{00}(P_i, P_j) + N_{01}(P_i, P_j) + N_{10}(P_i, P_j) + N_{11}(P_i, P_j)},$$ where $N_{m n}(P_i, P_j)$ is the number of observaitions where Alice observes $m$ using $P_i$ and Bob observes $n$ using $P_j$.\n",

It is also possible for the source to be compromised but a manipulation by the source still occurs during the same phase. Since Alice and Bob share $P_2$ and $P_3$, the eavesdropper will also use these bases and measure each qubit in one of these. If the eavesdropper is lucky, they along with Alice and Bob will choose the same basis and that digit will be compromised. If not however, the measurement done by them will destroy the correlation.
