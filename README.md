# Introduction

The Quantum Katas are a collection of self-paced tutorials and programming exercises to help you learn quantum computing and Q# programming.

Each kata is a separate set of exercises that includes:

* A sequence of tasks progressing from easy to hard.
  Each task requires you to fill in some code. The first task might require just one line, and the last one might require rather complicated code.
* A testing framework that sets up, runs, and validates your solutions.
  Each task is covered by a [unit test](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/test/getting-started-with-unit-testing) which initially fails. Once you write the code to make the test pass, you can move on to the next task.
* Links to quantum computing and Q# reference material you might need to solve the tasks.
* Hints, reference solutions and detailed explanations to help you if you're stuck.

The Quantum Katas also include *tutorials* that introduce the learner to the basic concepts and algorithms used in quantum computing, starting with the necessary math (complex numbers and linear algebra). They follow the same pattern of supplementing the theory with Q# demos and hands-on programming exercises.

## Run the katas and tutorials online <a name="run-online" /> ##

The Quantum Katas are now available as Jupyter Notebooks online! See [index.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?filepath=index.ipynb) for the list of all katas and tutorials, and instructions for running them online.

> While running the Katas online is the easiest option to get started, if you want to save your progress and enjoy better performance, we recommend you to choose the local option. 

## Run the katas locally <a name="kata-locally" /> ##

### Quantum Development Kit Installation <a name="install" /> ###

To use the Quantum Katas locally, you'll need the [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum), available for Windows 10, macOS, and Linux.
If you don't already have the Quantum Development Kit installed, see the [install guide for the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk).

**If you want to run the katas and tutorials locally as Jupyter Notebooks**:
1. Follow the steps in the [QDK install guide for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-python-qdk) 
  and the [QDK install guide for Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-jupyter-qdk).
2. Several tutorials require installing additional Python packages:
   * "Complex arithmetic" and "Linear algebra" require the [`pytest` package](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html).
   * "Exploring Grover's search algorithm" requires the [`matplotlib` package](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html).
   * "Quantum classification" requires [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html) and [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/install/) packages.

**If you want to run the katas and tutorials locally as Q# projects**:

Follow the steps in the [QDK install guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-command-line-qdk) for Visual Studio, 
 Visual Studio Code or other editors.


### Download the Quantum Katas <a name="download" /> ###

If you have Git installed, clone the Microsoft/QuantumKatas repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas.git
```

> [!TIP]
> Both Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio Code make it easy to clone repositories from within your development environment.
> For details, see the [Visual Studio 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/clone?view=azure-devops&tabs=visual-studio#clone-from-another-git-provider) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_cloning-a-repository) documentation.

If you don't have Git installed, download the katas from https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/archive/main.zip.


### Run a kata as a Jupyter Notebook <a name="kata-as-notebook" /> ###

The best way to run the katas as Jupyter Notebooks is to navigate to the root folder of the repository and to open `index.ipynb` using Jupyter:

```bash
$ cd QuantumKatas/
$ jupyter notebook index.ipynb
```

This will open the notebook that contains a list of all katas and tutorials, and you will be able to navigate to the one you want using links.

> Note that this will start Jupyter Notebooks server in the same command line window you used to run the command. If you want to keep using that window for navigation, you can launch Jupyter Notebooks server in a new window using the following commands (on Windows):
> ```bash
> $ cd QuantumKatas/
> $ start jupyter notebook index.ipynb
> ```

You can also open an individual notebook directly, but this might render internal links invalid:

```bash
$ cd QuantumKatas/tutorials/ComplexArithmetic
$ jupyter notebook ComplexArithmetic.ipynb
```


### Run a kata as a Q# project <a name="kata-as-project" /> ###

Each kata is in its own directory as a self-contained Q# project, solution and Jupyter Notebook triplet.
For instance, the BasicGates directory structure is:

```bash
QuantumKatas/
  BasicGates/
    README.md                  # Instructions specific to this kata.
    .vscode/                   # Metadata used by Visual Studio Code.
    BasicGates.sln             # Visual Studio 2019 solution file.
    BasicGates.csproj          # Project file used to build both classical and quantum code.
    BasicGates.ipynb           # Jupyter Notebook front-end for this kata.

    Tasks.qs                   # Q# source code that you will fill as you solve each task.
    Tests.qs                   # Q# tests that verify your solutions.
    TestSuiteRunner.cs         # C# source code used to run the Q# tests.
    ReferenceImplementation.qs # Q# source code containing solutions to the tasks.
```

To open the **BasicGates** kata in Visual Studio 2019, open the **QuantumKatas/BasicGates/BasicGates.sln** solution file.

To open the **BasicGates** kata in Visual Studio Code, open the **QuantumKatas/BasicGates/** folder.
Press **Ctrl + Shift + P** (or **⌘ + Shift + P** on macOS) to open the **Command Palette**. Type **Open Folder** on Windows 10 or Linux or **Open** on macOS.

> [!TIP]
> Almost all commands available in Visual Studio Code are in the Command Palette.
> If you get stuck, press **Ctrl + Shift + P** (or **⌘ + Shift + P** on macOS) and start typing to search through all available commands.
>
> You can also launch Visual Studio Code from the command line:
> ```bash
> $ code QuantumKatas/BasicGates/
> ```

### Run kata tests <a name="tests" /> ###

Once you have a kata open, it's time to run the tests using the following instructions.
Initially all tests will fail. Don't panic!
Open **Tasks.qs** and start filling in the code to complete the tasks. Each task is covered by a unit test. Once you fill in the correct code for a task, rebuild the project and re-run the tests, and the corresponding unit test will pass.

#### Visual Studio 2019

1. Build the solution.
2. From the main menu, open **Test Explorer** (**Test** > **Windows**) and select **Run All** to run all unit tests at once.
3. Work on the tasks in the **Tasks.qs** file.
4. To test your code changes for a task, rebuild the solution and re-run all unit tests using **Run All**, or run just the test for that task by right-clicking the test and selecting **Run Selected Tests**.

#### Visual Studio Code

1. Press **Ctrl + \`** (or **⌘ + \`** on macOS) to open the integrated terminal.
   The terminal should open to the kata directory. If it doesn't, navigate to the folder containing the *.csproj file for the kata using `cd` command.
2. Run `dotnet test` in the integrated terminal.
   This should build the kata project and run all of the unit tests. All of the unit tests should fail.
3. Work on the tasks in the **Tasks.qs** file.
4. To test your code changes for a task, from the integrated terminal run `dotnet test` again.

For convenience, a tasks.json configuration file exists for each kata. It allows Visual Studio Code to run the build and test steps from the Command Palette.
Press **Ctrl + Shift + P** (or **⌘ + Shift + P** on macOS) to open the Palette and type **Run Build Task** or **Run Test Task** and press **Enter**.

## Run katas locally with Docker <a name="docker" /> ##

You can use the included [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to create a docker image with all the necessary tools to run the katas from the command line or Jupyter.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
2. Build the docker image and tag it `katas`:

```bash
docker build -t katas .
```

3. Run the image in the container named `katas-container` with interactive command-line and redirect container port `8888` to local port `8888` (needed to run Jupyter):

```bash
docker run -it --name katas-container -p 8888:8888 katas /bin/bash
```

4. From the same command line that you used to run the container, run the C# version of the **BasicGates** kata:

```bash
cd ~/BasicGates/
dotnet test
```

5. Start a Jupyter Notebook within the image for the **BasicGates** kata:

```bash
cd ~/BasicGates/ && jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

6. Once Jupyter has started, use your browser to open the kata in notebook format. You
will need a token generated by Jupyter when it started on the previous step:

```
http://localhost:8888/notebooks/BasicGates.ipynb
```

To exit a docker container without killing it (daemon mode), press **Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Q**

To re-enter the existing `katas-container` (in daemon mode):

```bash
docker attach katas-container
```

Once you're done, remove the `katas-container`:

```bash
docker rm --force katas-container
```
