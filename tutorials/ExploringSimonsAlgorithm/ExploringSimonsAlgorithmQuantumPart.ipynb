    "# Exploring Simon's Periodicity Algorithm: Quantum Component\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simon's periodicity algorithm** is a well-known oracle-based quantum computing algorithm about finding patterns in functions. It is famous for solving [Simon's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%27s_problem) exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm. Simon's algorithm contains both quantum and classical procedures. While the algorithm itself has little practical value, it is a useful learning tool for illustrating important concepts like quantum oracles. As such, Simon's algorithm is part of many introductory courses on quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will:\n",
    "* introduce you to the problem solved by Simon's algorithm,\n",
    "* walk you through the overview of the algorithm,\n",
    "* give you practice implementing relevant quantum oracles using the Q# programming language, and\n",
    "* give you practice implementing the quantum circuit for Simon's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section of the tutorial you will continue exploration of Simon's algorithm in a [companion Python notebook](./ExploringSimonsAlgorithmClassicalPart.ipynb) that will introduce you to the classical component of the algorithm.\n",

    "Further, you are assured that there exists a secret set of $n$ boolean variables $\\mathbf{s} = (s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n-1})$ such that for all $\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{y} \\in\\ \\{0, 1\\}^n$,\n",
