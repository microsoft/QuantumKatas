    "## 1. Circuit-centric Quantum Classifiers: an Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit-centric quantum classifiers have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data encoding.  \n",
    "The features of a data sample are encoded as the amplitudes of a quantum state. This state further serves as the input to the classification circuit. The encoding is parameter-free and uses only the raw data of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classification model circuit.  \n",
    "The classification circuit is a small-depth circuit of single-qubit rotations and two-qubit controlled rotations. \n",
    "The circuit geometry (the sequence of the rotations and the qubits to which they are applied) is fixed for the model, and the parameters of the model (the rotation angles) are learned during the training phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Measurement.  \n",
    "Applying the classification circuit to the data encoded as a quantum state yields the final quantum state. \n",
    "Measuring the \"output\" qubit of that state allows us to get a classical result - 0 or 1. \n",
    "However, that is not the final classification result yet...\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Result interpretation.  \n",
    "The steps 1-3 are repeated multiple times to estimate the probability of getting 0 or 1 in the final measurement.\n",
    "This probability is compared with a threshold (classifier bias) to produce the final classification result.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the theory behind circuit-centric quantum classifiers in the [Microsoft QDK documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/libraries/machine-learning/introduction) or in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00633). \n",
