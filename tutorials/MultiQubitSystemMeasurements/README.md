# Welcome!

This tutorial introduces the basics of quantum measurements for multi-qubit systems.

You can run the tutorial online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?filepath=tutorials/MultiQubitSystemMeasurements/MultiQubitSystemMeasurements.ipynb).
Alternatively, you can install Jupyter and Q# on your machine, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide#develop-with-jupyter-notebooks), and run the tutorial locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from the command line using the following command:

    jupyter notebook MultiQubitSystemMeasurements.ipynb
