For example, if one wants to measure a two-qubit system in the computational basis, one can implement this by first measuring the first qubit in the computational basis to obtain $0$ or $1$, and then measuring the second qubit in the computational basis. This can result in one of the four possible outcomes: $00, 01, 10, 11$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> Note that measuring all qubits one after another can only be used to measure in orthogonal bases $\\{ \\ket{b_i}\\}$ such that each $\\ket{b_i}$ is a 'tensor product state'. That is, each $\\ket{b_i}$ must be of the form $\\ket{v_0} \\otimes \\ket{v_1} \\dotsc \\otimes \\ket{v_{n-1}}$, with each $\\ket{v_j}$ being a single-qubit basis state. \n",
    "For example, for the 2-qubit Pauli X basis $\\ket{++}, \\ket{+-}, \\ket{-+}, \\ket{--}$ each basis state is a tensor product of states $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$, which form a single-qubit basis state.\n",

    "> Measuring in orthogonal bases which contain states which are not tensor product states, such as the Bell basis, are trickier to implement, and require appropriate unitary rotations in addition to measuring all qubits one after another. \n",

Furthermore, as long as all the qubits are measured, the sequence in which they are measured is also inconsequential. These factors can be  important in the case of real quantum computers with imperfect qubits, but we restrict the discussion to ideal systems in this tutorial.\n",

    "> It is useful to revisit the concepts of entanglement and separable states, which were introduced in the [tutorial on multi-qubit systems](../MultiQubitSystems/MultiQubitSystems.ipynb#Entanglement). Consider a system of $n>1$ number of qubits, which we divide into two parts: A, consisting of $m$ qubits, and B, consisting of the remaining $n-m$ qubits. We say that the state $\\ket \\psi$ of the entire system is separable if it can be expressed as a tensor product of the states of parts A and B: \n",

    "\\ket \\psi = \\ket {\\phi_A} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi_B}\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a measurement on the subsystem $A$ of a separable state. Let the measurement be done in a basis $\\{ \\ket{b_0},\\dotsc,\\ket{b_{2^m-1}}\\}$.

The corresponding post-measurement state of the system is then given by\n",

The results of a subsequent measurement on subsystem $B$, including outcome probabilities, will be independent of the result of the first measurement. In other words, the outcomes of the two measurements will be uncorrelated.\n",
