Building upon those ideas, this tutorial will introduce you to the concepts involved in, and the `Q#` implementation of measurements done on multi-qubit systems. This will involved measuring a single qubit in a multi-qubit system, as well as measuring multiple qubits simultaneously. \n",

    "## Types of measurements\n",
    "Measurements in an n-qubit system ($n>1$) are of the following types:\n",
    "- Measuring all the qubits simultaneously in an orthogonal basis ($2^n$ possible outcomes) .\n",
    "- Partial Measurements ($2^m$ possible outcomes, if $m<n$ number of qubits are measured).\n",
    "- Joint Measurements ($2$ possible outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of outcomes for the three types of measurements are different. As we shall see below, the first type of measurement is a direct generalization of the concept of single qubit measurements introduced in the previous tutorial. Related to such measurements are partial measurements, which involve a partial collapse of the system's wavefunction since only some of the qubits are measured. On the other hand, joint measurements are usually done on all the qubits in a system simultaneously, but can result in only one out of two outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss these concepts in the same order as in the list above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurements in multi-qubit bases\n",
    "Consider a system consisting of $n\\geq1$ qubits. The wavefunction of such a system belongs to a vector space of dimension $2^n$. Thus, the vector space is spanned by an orthogonal basis such as the computational basis which consists of the vectors $|0\\dotsc0\\rangle, \\dotsc, |1\\dotsc 1\\rangle$. For generality, we consider an arbitrary orthonormal basis, which we denote by $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$. Then, the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ of the multi-qubit system can be expressed as a linear combination of the $2^n$ basis vectors. That is, there exist complex numbers $c_0,c_1,\\dotsc, c_{2^n-1}$ such that\n",
    " $$\n",
    " |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} c_i|b_i\\rangle \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix}c_0 \\\\ c_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c_{2^n-1}\\end{pmatrix}.\n",
    " $$\n",
    " In line with the usual convention, we choose the wavefunction to be normalized, so that $|c_0|^2 + \\dotsc + |c_{2^n-1}|^2 =1$. Then, a quantum measurement in the $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$ basis satisfies the following rules:\n",
    " - The measurement outcome $b_i$ occurs with probability $|c_i|^2$. \n",
    " - Whenever the measurement outcome is $b_i$, the wavefunction collapses to the state $|b_i\\rangle$. That is, the post measurement state of the system is equal to $|b_i\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be summarized in the following table:\n",
    "<table style=\"border:1px solid\">\n",
    "    <col width=150>\n",
    "    <col width=150>\n",
    "    <col width=150>\n",

    " \n",
    " \n",
    "> Similar to measurements in single qubit systems, the assumption of normalization of the original wavefunction is required for the applicability of the statements above, in order to ensure that the sum of all the outcome probabilities is one."

    "## Measuring all qubits in a system one after another\n",
    "As described in the previous sections, in theory, it is possible to measure all the qubits in an n-qubit system simultaneously in an orthogonal basis. The post-measurement state of the qubits is then exactly one out of the $2^n$ possible basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is implemented by measuring all the qubits one after another. For example, if one wants to measure a two-qubit system in the computational basis, one can implement this by first measuring the first qubit in the computational basis to obtain 0 or 1, followed by a computational basis measurement for the second qubit. This can result in one of the four possible outcomes: $\\ket{00}, \\ket{01}, \\ket{10}, \\ket{11}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "> The distinction between measuring all the qubits simultaneously, as opposed to one after another is not important for an ideal computer: in terms of the outcomes and measurement probabilities, both are identical. Furthermore, as long as all the qubits are measured, the sequence in which they are measured is also inconsequential. (However, these factors can be  important to consider for real quantum computers with imperfect qubits, but we restrict the discussion to ideal systems in this tutorial.) \n",

As an example, consider the computational basis measurements for a single qubit system. This corresponds to the operator $Z$ (i.e. the Pauli Z operator).\n"
