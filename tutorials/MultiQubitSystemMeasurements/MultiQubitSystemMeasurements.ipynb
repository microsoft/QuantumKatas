    "## Types of measurements\n",
    "Measurements in an n-qubit system ($n>1$) are of the following types:\n",
    "- Measuring all the qubits simultaneously in an orthogonal basis ($2^n$ possible outcomes) .\n",
    "- Partial Measurements ($2^m$ possible outcomes if $m<n$ number of qubits are measured).\n",
    "- Joint Measurements ($2$ possible outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of outcomes for the three types of measurements are different. As we shall see below, the first type of measurement is a direct generalization of orthogonal basis measurements done in single qubit systems introduced in the previous tutorial. Related to such measurements are partial measurements, which involve a partial collapse of the system's wavefunction since only some of the qubits are measured. On the other hand, joint measurements are usually done on all the qubits in a system simultaneously, but can result in only one out of two possible outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss these concepts in the same order as in the list above.\n",

    "## Full measurements: Measurements in multi-qubit bases\n",
    "Consider a system consisting of $n\\geq1$ qubits. The wavefunction of such a system belongs to a vector space of dimension $2^n$. Thus, the vector space is spanned by an orthogonal basis such as the computational basis which consists of the vectors $|0\\dotsc0\\rangle, \\dotsc, |1\\dotsc 1\\rangle$. For generality, we consider an arbitrary orthonormal basis, which we denote by $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$. Then, the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ of the multi-qubit system can be expressed as a linear combination of the $2^n$ basis vectors. That is, there exist complex numbers $c_0,c_1,\\dotsc, c_{2^n-1}$ such that\n",

    " $$\n",
    " In line with the usual convention, we choose the wavefunction to be normalized, so that $|c_0|^2 + \\dotsc + |c_{2^n-1}|^2 =1$. Then, a quantum measurement in the $\\{ |b_0\\rangle, |b_1\\rangle, \\dotsc, |b_{2^n-1}\\rangle \\}$ basis satisfies the following rules:\n",
    " - The measurement outcome $b_i$ occurs with probability $|c_i|^2$. \n",
    " - Whenever the measurement outcome is $b_i$, the wavefunction collapses to the state $|b_i\\rangle$. That is, the post measurement state of the system is equal to $|b_i\\rangle$.\n",

    "## Measuring all qubits in a system one after another\n",
    "As described in the previous sections, in theory, it is possible to measure all the qubits in an n-qubit system simultaneously in an orthogonal basis. The post-measurement state of the qubits is then exactly one out of the $2^n$ possible basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is implemented by measuring all the qubits one after another. For example, if one wants to measure a two-qubit system in the computational basis, one can implement this by first measuring the first qubit in the computational basis to obtain 0 or 1, followed by a computational basis measurement for the second qubit. This can result in one of the four possible outcomes: $\\ket{00}, \\ket{01}, \\ket{10}, \\ket{11}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be generalized to measurements in other bases, such as $\\ket{++}, \\ket{+-}, \\ket{-+}, \\ket{--}$, and for a larger number of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We note that measuring all qubits one after another can only be used to measure in orthogonal bases $\\{ \\ket{b_i}| i=0,\\dotsc, 2^n-1 \\}$ such that each $\\ket{b_i} \\}$ is a 'tensor product state'. That is, each $\\ket{b_i}$ must be of the form $\\ket{v_0} \\otimes \\ket{v_1} \\dotsc \\otimes \\ket{v_{n-1}}$, with each $\\ket{v_j}$ being a single qubit state. Measuring in orthogonal bases which contain states which are not tensor product states are harded to implement, and require appropriate unitary rotations in addition to measuring all qubits one after another. We will not discuss such measurements in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Restricting to measurements in tensor product states, we note that the distinction between measuring all the qubits simultaneously, as opposed to one after another is not important for an ideal quantum computer: in terms of the outcomes and measurement probabilities, both are identical. Furthermore, as long as all the qubits are measured, the sequence in which they are measured is also inconsequential. (However, these factors can be  important in the case of real quantum computers with imperfect qubits, but we restrict the discussion to ideal systems in this tutorial.) \n",
