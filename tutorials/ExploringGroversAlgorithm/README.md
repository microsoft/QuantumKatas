# Welcome!

This folder contains a tutorial on the Grover's search algorithm - one of the most famous algorithms in quantum computing. It focuses on exploring the high-level behavior of the algorithm.

You can run the tutorial online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?filepath=tutorials/ExploringGroversAlgorithm%2FExploringGroversAlgorithmTutorial.ipynb). 
Alternatively, you can install Jupyter and Q# on your machine, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-jupyter-qdk), and run the tutorial locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from command line using the following command: 

    jupyter notebook ExploringGroversAlgorithmTutorial.ipynb

The Q# project in this folder contains the back-end of the tutorial and is not designed for direct use.
