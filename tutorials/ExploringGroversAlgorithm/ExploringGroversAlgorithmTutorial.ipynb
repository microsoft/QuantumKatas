    "**Grover's search algorithm** is one of the most famous algorithms in quantum computing. The problem it solves is often referred to as \"searching a database\", but it is more accurate to think of it as \"inverting a function\". The algorithm can have practical value when applied on its own, but it can also be generalized and used as a building block for other algorithms. As such, Grover's algorithm is part of almost every introductory course on quantum computing.\n",

    "This tutorial will:\n",
    "* introduce you to the general problem solved by the Grover's algorithm,\n",
    "* walk you through some of the practical aspects of the algorithm,\n",
    "* and teach you to write code to explore applying them to a task of solving SAT problems using the Q# programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section of the tutorial you will continue exploration of Grover's algorithm in a [companion Python notebook](./VisualizingGroversAlgorithm.ipynb) that will \n",

    "[Boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) (abbreviated as SAT problem) is a problem of finding an assignment of values to boolean variables that satisfies a given boolean formula or determining that such assignment does not exist. \n",
