# Welcome!

This folder contains a tutorial on linear algebra that explains some of the mathematical background required to work with quantum computing.
Linear algebra describes the properties of matrices and vectors, which are used to represent quantum states and operations on those states.

You can run the tutorial online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/master?filepath=tutorials/LinearAlgebra/LinearAlgebra.ipynb).
Alternatively, you can install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) on your machine (this tutorial does not require Q#), and run the tutorial locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from the command line using the following command:

    jupyter notebook LinearAlgebra.ipynb

The Python file in this folder contains the back-end of the tutorial and is not intended for direct use.
