    "\n",
    "**Quantum error correction (QEC)** is used in quantum computing to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Quantum error correction is *essential* if one is to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation that can deal not only with noise on stored quantum information, but also with faulty quantum gates, faulty quantum preparation, and faulty measurements.\n",

    "\n",
    "Classical error correction employs redundancy. The simplest way to reliably store information is to store it multiple times and if in future due to an unknown error it conflicst - just take a majority vote. However copying quantum information is not possible due to the [*no-cloning theorem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem). The no-cloning theorem states that there is no Unitary Operation $U$ such that $\\forall |\\phi\\rangle$ $U|\\psi\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle = |\\phi\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle$. \n",

    "## Types of Error\n",
    "\n",
    "In Classical Bits the only possible states are $0$ and $1$. Hence the only kind of error is a bit flip error. This error involves a bit randomly flipping: $0 \\rightarrow 1$ or $1 \\rightarrow 0$. Such an error can be modelled by randomly applying a $NOT$ gate to a bit. Classically these errors are often detected and corrected by introducing duplication of data and parity check bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Quantum Computing, the possible errors are not limited to bit flips, but also include sign flips (or phase flips). The most general error can be thought of as a Unitary $E$ applied to a qubit. \n",
    "\n",
    "A single qubit Unitary $U$ can be represented as a linear combination of the *Pauli Matrices* $\\{\\sigma_I,\\sigma_X,\\sigma_Y,\\sigma_Z\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U = c_I\\sigma_I + c_X\\sigma_X + c_Y\\sigma_Y + c_Z\\sigma_Z$$\n",

    "$$|c_I|^2+|c_X|^2+|c_Y|^2+|c_Z|^2,$$\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{R}(c_Ic_X*) + \\mathcal{I}(c_Yc_Z*) = 0,$$\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{R}(c_Ic_Y*) + \\mathcal{I}(c_Xc_Z*) = 0,$$\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{R}(c_Ic_Z*) + \\mathcal{I}(c_Xc_Y*) = 0,$$\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{I}$ are the Real and Imaginary Components respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma_Y$ can also be represnted in terms of $\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Z$, since $\\sigma_Y = i\\sigma_X\\sigma_Z$. Hence we can rewrite the Unitary $U$ as $c_I\\sigma_I + c_X\\sigma_X + c_Z\\sigma_Z + c_{XZ}\\sigma_X\\sigma_Z$. A circuit which can correct all errors in the following group $\\{I,X,Z,XZ\\}$ can correct any single qubit error due to linearity."

    "In classical computing, the bit can only be in the states $0$ and $1$. These states form the 2 logical states for classical computation. Error Correction involves duplicating these logical bits into multiple physical bits in order to make classical computing more fault-tolerant.
