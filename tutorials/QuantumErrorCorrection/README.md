# Welcome!

This folder contains a Notebook tutorial on Quantum Error Correction - 
an application of quantum computing that is used in quantum computing to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise.

You can run the tutorial online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/master?filepath=tutorials/QuantumErrorCorrection%2FQuantumErrorCorrection.ipynb). Alternatively, you can install Jupyter and Q# on your machine, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide/jupyter), and run the tutorial locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from command line using the following command: 

    jupyter notebook QuantumErrorCorrection.ipynb

The Q# project in this folder contains the back-end of the tutorial and is not designed for direct use.
