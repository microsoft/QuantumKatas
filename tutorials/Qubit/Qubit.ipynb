    "The basic building block of a classical computer is the bit - a single memory cell that is either in state $0$ or in state $1$. Similarly, the basic building block of a quantum computer is the quantum bit, or **qubit**. Like the classical bit, a qubit can be in state $0$ or in state $1$. Unlike the classical bit, however, the qubit isn't limited to just those two states - it may also be in a combination, or **superposition** of those states.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A common misconception about quantum computing is that a qubit is always in one state or the other, we just don't know which one until we \"measure\" it. That is not the case. A qubit in a superposition is in a state between the states $0$ and $1$. When a qubit is measured, it is forced entirely into one state or the other - in other words, measuring it actually changes its state."
