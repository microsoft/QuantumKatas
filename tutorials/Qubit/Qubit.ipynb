    "The basic building block of a classical computer is the bit - a single memory cell that is either in state $0$ or in state $1$. Similarly, the basic building block of a quantum computer is the quantum bit, or **qubit**. Like the classical bit, a qubit can be in state $0$ or in state $1$. Unlike the classical bit, however, the qubit isn't limited to just those two states - it may also be in a combination, or **superposition** of those states.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A common misconception about quantum computing is that a qubit is always in one state or the other, we just don't know which one until we \"measure\" it. That is not the case. A qubit in a superposition is in a state between the states $0$ and $1$. When a qubit is measured, it is forced entirely into one state or the other - in other words, measuring it actually changes its state."

    "# Relative and Global Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall that a complex number has a parameter called its phase. If a complex number $x$ is written in [polar form](../ComplexArithmetic/ComplexArithmetic.ipynb#Polar-coordinates) $x = re^{i\\theta}$, its phase is $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase of a basis state is the complex phase of the amplitude of that state. For example, a system in state $\\frac{1 + i}{2}|0\\rangle + \\frac{1 - i}{2}|1\\rangle$, the phase of $|0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$, and the phase of $|1\\rangle$ is $-\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The difference between these two phases is known as **relative phase**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying the state of the entire system by $e^{i\\theta}$ doesn't affect the relative phase: $\\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle$ has the same relative phase as $e^{i\\theta}\\big(\\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle\\big)$. In the second expression, $\\theta$ is known as the system's **global phase**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of a qubit (or, more generally, the state of a quantum system) is defined by its relative phase - global phase arises as a consequence of using linear algebra to represent qubits, and has no physical meaning. That is, applying a phase to the entire state of a system (multiplying the entire vector by $e^{i\\theta}$ for any real $\\theta$) doesn't actually affect the state of the system. Because of this, global phase is sometimes known as **unobservable phase** or **hidden phase**."
