    "Adding imaginary numbers to each other is quite simple, but what happens when we add a real number to an imaginary number? The result of that addition will be partly real and partly imaginary, otherwise known as a **complex number**. A complex number is simply the real part and the imaginary part being treated as a single number. Complex numbers are generally written as the sum of their two parts: $a + bi$, where both $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. For example, $3 + 4i$, or $-5 - 7i$ are valid complex numbers. Note that purely real or purely imaginary numbers can also be written as complex numbers: $2$ is $2 + 0i$, and $-3i$ is $0 - 3i$.\n",
