# Welcome!

This folder contains a tutorial on complex arithmetic that explains some of the mathematical background required to work with quantum computing.
Complex arithmetic deals with imaginary and complex numbers, which arise from an attempt to take the square root of negative numbers.

You can run the tutorial online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?urlpath=/notebooks/tutorials/ComplexArithmetic/ComplexArithmetic.ipynb).
Alternatively, you can install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) on your machine (this tutorial does not require Q#), and run the tutorial locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from the command line using the following command:

    jupyter notebook ComplexArithmetic.ipynb

The Python file in this folder contains the back-end of the tutorial and is not intended for direct use.
