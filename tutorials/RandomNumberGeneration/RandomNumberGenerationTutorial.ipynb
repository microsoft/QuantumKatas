    "True random number generation is a notoriously difficult problem. Many \"random\" generators today are actually pseudo-random, using a starting seed to spawning seemingly-random numbers that are actually a repeatable function of that seed. Most true random number generations are based on measurements of some natural phenomenon, such as atmospheric noise or atomic decay. \n",
    "(You can read more about it [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation).) \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are truly random. The quantum algorithm for random number generation is one of the simplest applications of quantum computing principles, requiring very few qubits to run.\n",

    "* learn about quantum random number generation and the principles behind it,\n",
    "* implement a variety of QRNGs with equal probability of any given number,\n",
    "* implement a single-bit QRNG with weighted probabilities of generated bits.\n",

    "Recall from the [Qubit](../Qubit/Qubit.ipynb) tutorial that a qubit state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined via the basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{bmatrix} = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle\\text{, where }|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We call $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ the **amplitudes** of states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, respectively. \n",
    "When $|\\psi\\rangle$ is measured in the $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$ basis (the computational basis), the probabilities of the outcomes are defined based on the state amplitudes: there is a $|\\alpha|^2$ probability that the measurement result will be $0$, and a $|\\beta|^2$ probability that the measurement result will be $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, a qubit in state $\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{bmatrix}$ will yield measurement results $0$ or $1$ with equal probability, while a qubit in state $\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt3}{2} \\end{bmatrix}$ will yield measurement result $0$ only 25% of the time, and $1$ 75% of the time.\n",
