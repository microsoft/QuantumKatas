# Welcome!

This folder contains a Notebook tutorial on quantum random number generation - 
an application of quantum computing that requires few qubits and offers true random numbers generated using the principles of quantum mechanics.

You can run the tutorial online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?filepath=tutorials/RandomNumberGeneration%2FRandomNumberGenerationTutorial.ipynb). Alternatively, you can install Jupyter and Q# on your machine, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-jupyter-qdk), and run the tutorial locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from command line using the following command: 

    jupyter notebook RandomNumberGenerationTutorial.ipynb

The Q# project in this folder contains the back-end of the tutorial and is not designed for direct use.
