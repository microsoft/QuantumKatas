    "**What is this workbook?**\n",
    "A workbook is a collection of problems, accompanied by solutions to them. \n",
    "The explanations focus on the logical steps required to solve a problem; they illustrate the concepts that need to be applied to come up with a solution to the problem, explaining the mathematical steps required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a workbook should not be the primary source of knowledge on the subject matter; it assumes that you've already read a tutorial or a textbook and that you are now seeking to improve your problem-solving skills. You should attempt solving the tasks of the respective kata first, and turn to the workbook only if stuck. While a textbook emphasizes knowledge acquisition, a workbook emphasizes skill acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook describes the solutions to the problems offered in the [Random Number Generation Tutorial](./RandomNumberGenerationTutorial.ipynb). \n",
    "Since the tasks are offered as programming problems, the explanations also cover some elements of Q# that might be non-obvious for a first-time user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should know for this workbook**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be familiar with the following concepts before tackling the Quantum Random Number Generation Tutorial (and this workbook):\n",

    "1. The concept of qubit and measurement\n",

When we measure the qubit, we get either 0 with probability $|\\alpha|^2$ or 1 with probability $|\\beta|^2$. Essentially we can control probablity of measurement outcome by setting the right amplitudes of basis states. \n",

    "When we allocate the qubit in Q#, amplitudes $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are 1 and 0, respectively. Now our goal is set equal amplitudes for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for absolute randomness. We can achieve that by simply applying Hadamard gate to the initial state $|0\\rangle$:\n",
