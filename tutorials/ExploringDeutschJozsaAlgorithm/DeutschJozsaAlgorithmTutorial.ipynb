    "\n",
    "The **Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm** is one of the most famous algorithms in quantum computing. The problem it solves has little practical value, but the algorithm itself is one of the earliest examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic algorithm for the same problem. It is also relatively simple to explain and illustrates several very important concepts (such as quantum oracles). As such, Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm is part of almost every introductory course on quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will:\n",
    "* introduce you to the problem solved by the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm and walk you through the classical solution to it,\n",
    "* give you a brief introduction to quantum oracles (for a more detailed introduction, see the [Oracles tutorial](../Oracles/Oracles.ipynb)),\n",
    "* describe the idea behind the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm and walk you through the math for it,\n",
    "* teach you how to implement the algorithm in the Q# programming language,\n",

    "* or *balanced* (has value 0 for half of the inputs and 1 for the other half of the inputs). \n",

    "> * $f(x) = x \\text{ mod } 2$ (the least significant bit of $x$) or $f(x) = 1 \\text{ if the binary notation of }x \\text{ has odd number of 1s and 0 otherwise}$ are examples of balanced functions.  \n",
    ">   Indeed, for both these functions you can check that for every possible input $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$ there exists an input $x^\\prime$ (equal to $x$ with the least significant bit flipped) such that $f(x^\\prime) = 1$, and vice versa, which means that the function is balanced.  \n",

    "## Definition\n",
    "A quantum oracle is a \"black box\" operation which is used as input to another algorithm. This operation is implemented in a way which allows to perform calculations not only on individual inputs, but also on superpositions of inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This is *not* the same as being able to evaluate the function on all inputs at once, since you will not be able to extract the evaluation results!\n",
    "\n",
    "Oracles are often defined using a classical function, in the case of Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm the function $f : \\{0, 1\\}^N \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ takes an $N$-bit binary input and produces an 1-bit binary output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle has to act on quantum states instead of classical values. \n",
    "To enable this, integer input $x$ is represented in binary $x = (x_{0}, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{N-1})$, \n",
    "and encoded into an $N$-qubit register: $|\\vec{x} \\rangle = |x_{0} \\rangle \\otimes |x_{1} \\rangle \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes |x_{N-1} \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of oracles used in this tutorial are called *phase oracles*. A phase oracle $U_f$ encodes the value of the classical function $f$ it implements in the phase of the qubit state as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f |\\vec{x} \\rangle = (-1)^{f(x)} |\\vec{x} \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case $f$ can return only two values, 0 or 1, which result in no phase change or adding a $-1$ phase, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of such an oracle on any single basis state is not particularly interesting: it just adds a global phase which is not something you can observe. However, if you apply this oracle to a *superposition* of basis states, its effect becomes noticeable. \n",
    "Remember that quantum operations are linear: if you define the effect of an operation on the basis states, you'll be able to deduce its effect on superposition states (which are just linear combinations of the basis states) using its linearity. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Example: Deutsch algorithm\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Consider, for example, the case of $N = 1$: there are two possible inputs to the function, $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, and we can apply the oracle to their superposition:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$U_f \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\big( |0\\rangle + |1\\rangle \\big) \\right) \n",

    "= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\big( (-1)^{f(0)} |0\\rangle + (-1)^{f(1)} |1\\rangle \\big)$$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * If $f(0) = f(1)$, the phases of the two basis states are the same, and the resulting state is $|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\big( |0\\rangle + |1\\rangle \\big)$ (up to a global phase). \n",
    "> * If $f(0) \\neq f(1)$, the phases of the two basis states differ by a factor of $-1$, and the resulting state is $|-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\big( |0\\rangle - |1\\rangle \\big)$ (up to a global phase). \n",
    "> * The states $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ can be distinguished using measurement: if you apply the H gate to each of them, you'll get $H|+\\rangle = |0\\rangle$ if $f(0) = f(1)$, or $H|-\\rangle = |1\\rangle$ if $f(0) \\neq f(1)$. This means that one oracle call does not let you calculate both $f(0)$ and $f(1)$, but it allows you to figure out whether $f(0) = f(1)$.\n",
