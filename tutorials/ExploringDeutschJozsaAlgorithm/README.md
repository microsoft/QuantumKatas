# Welcome!

This folder contains a Notebook tutorial on the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm - a quantum computing algorithm that has no practical use, but is famous for being one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any deterministic classical algorithm.

You can run the tutorial online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/master?filepath=tutorials/ExploringDeutschJozsaAlgorithm%2FDeutschJozsaAlgorithmTutorial.ipynb). Alternatively, you can install Jupyter and Q# on your machine, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide/jupyter), and run the tutorial locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from command line using the following command: 

    jupyter notebook DeutschJozsaAlgorithmTutorial.ipynb

The Q# project in this folder contains the back-end of the tutorial and is not designed for direct use.
