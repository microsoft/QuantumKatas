# Welcome!

The Counting kata covers the quantum counting algorithm, which is based on Grover's search algorithm.
It solves the problem of computing the number of assignments of Boolean input variables 
that make a Boolean function (oracle) true.

#### Theory

* The tasks follow the explanation from *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen and Chuang.
  In the 10th anniversary edition, this is section 6.3 on pages 261-263.
