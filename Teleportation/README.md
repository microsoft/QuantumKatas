# Welcome!

The teleportation kata covers quantum teleportation - a protocol which allows to communicate a quantum state
using only classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement.

You can [run the Teleportation kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?urlpath=/notebooks/Teleportation%2FTeleportation.ipynb)!

 - Another description can be found in [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation).
 - An interactive demonstration can be found [on the Wolfram Demonstrations Project](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/QuantumTeleportation/).

The principle of deferred measurement, applied to teleportation protocol, is described in Nielsen & Chuang, section 4.4 (pp. 185-187).
