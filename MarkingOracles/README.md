# Welcome!

This kata teaches you to implement marking oracles for classical functions in Q#.

* [Oracles tutorial](./../tutorials/Oracles/) introduces you to the concept of quantum oracles and gets you started on some simple examples.
* The [Grover's Algorithm kata](./../GroversAlgorithm/) and the [Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm kata](./../DeutschJozsaAlgorithm) include tasks on implementing marking oracles for simple classical functions in Q#. Those tasks are a good place to practice this topic before continuing to the more advanced tasks in this kata.
* [SolveSATWithGrover](./../SolveSATWithGrover/) is a kata covering marking oracle implementation for solving constraint satisfaction problems.
* [GraphColoring](./../GraphColoring/) is a kata covering marking oracle implementation for solving graph coloring problems.
* [BoundedKnapsack](./../BoundedKnapsack/) is a kata covering marking oracle implementation for solving bounded knapsack problems.
